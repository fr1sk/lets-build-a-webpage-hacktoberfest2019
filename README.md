# lets-build-a-webpage-hacktoberfest2019 [LIVE WEBSITE](https://fr1sk.github.io/lets-build-a-webpage-hacktoberfest2019/)

Community-driven webpage! Inspired by [🎃Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)!


Let's try to create a crazy community-driven webpage (something similar to [portfolio](https://bennycarlsson.github.io/MyPortfolio-Hacktoberfest2019/), [git](https://github.com/BennyCarlsson/MyPortfolio-Hacktoberfest2019)). Hacktoberfest army, are you ready? 🚀
Feel free to add whatever you want (eg. easter eggs, weird stuff, silly animations, etc.) and lets try to see what can we create from it. 👨🏻‍🎨 

If you have any questions or requests drop me a message! 📧
Creemos una pagina divertida.
# Rules for contributing 👨🏻‍💻

### ✅
* Try to add something funny (get inspiration from portfolio site above), don't just try to add something just for PR, open your mind 🙏🏻
* Keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts.
* Make sure there is no merge conflict
* Add fun and weird things. This is not serious project, add easter eggs and ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ stuff. 🐮

### ❌
* DONT SPAM! If you are able to fix small error or improve some small thing, thats ok, but don't try to add something just to add (eg. just a console.log)
* Don't use prettier/auto indent/auto format we don't want merge conflicts, right?
* Use simple things, don't add some huge library!

# Ideas 🧠
* Add more weird and silly stuff (animations, colors, easter eggs)
* Add layout to index.html
* Style the index.html
* Update Readme.md
* Check issues for more things to do
* Spelling and grammar


## please ⭐ the project, and lets 🚀 it together!
